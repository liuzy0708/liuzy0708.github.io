    👋 Welcome to My Personal Homepage
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; margin: 0;">
    I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the <strong>Department of Automation</strong> at <strong>Tsinghua University</strong>, working under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1092/1527.htm" style="color: #667eea; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #667eea;">Xiao He</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1582.htm" style="color: #667eea; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #667eea;">Donghua Zhou</a> at the Research Center of Safety Control Technology. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; margin: 15px 0 0 0;">
    Prior to this, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Southwest University. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in the Laboratory of Information Fusion and Intelligent Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China with Prof. Yong Deng, and also at Chongqing University with Prof. Fuyuan Xiao.

  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.8; color: #2c3e50; margin: 0;">
    My research focuses on <em>online learning</em> and its applications in <em>real-time safety assessment</em>, <em>safety-guaranteed control</em>, and <em>multi-condition fault diagnosis</em> of dynamic systems, such as robotic swarms, industrial automation systems, and safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In addition, I am interested in applying the advanced process monitoring technologies developed in this context to tackle critical challenges in environmental engineering, particularly in domains such as hydrology and atmospheric science.
