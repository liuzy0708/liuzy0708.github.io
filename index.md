<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Dept. of Automation, Tsinghua University. My research interests include **Online Active Learning**, **Online Semi-supervised Learning**, **eXplainable Artificial Intelligence** (XAI), **Decision-making**, **Information Fusion**, and their applications in **Real-time Fault Diagnosis** and **Real-time Safety Assessment** of dynamic systems. Currently, I focus on applying stream learning techniques under constrained annotations to the complex dynamic systems in industrial processes.

I studied in the School of Computer and Information Science at Southwest University for the B.E. degree. My major was Computer Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I served as a research assistant in the research groups of Prof. [Y. Deng][1] and Prof. [F. Xiao][2], respectively, and carried out research work related to intelligent decision science. After receiving my B.E. degree, I was recommended to study directly for a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, majoring in Control Science and Control Engineering. I am currently advised by Prof. [X. He][3] and Prof. [D.-H. Zhou][4] from [Dept. of Automation][5], Tsinghua University.
