<span style="font-size: 23px;">Welcome to my personal homepageðŸ‘‹</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, with Prof. <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1092/1527.htm">Xiao He</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1582.htm">Donghua Zhou</a> at the Research Center of Safety Control Technology. Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from Southwest University, majoring in computer science and technology. During that time, I served as a research assistant in the Laboratory of Information Fusion and Intelligent Science, led by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao">Yong Deng</a>.

    My research interests include *online learning* and its applications in *multi-mode fault diagnosis* and *real-time safety assessment* of dynamic systems. Currently, I focus on applying stream learning techniques under constrained annotations to the complex dynamic systems in industrial processes.
